# 100 Days Of Code - Schaxmann's Log

### Day 1: Friday 28th September, 2018

**Today's Progress:** <br>
Signed up for GitHub, StackOverflow, 100-days-of-code Slack, FreeCodeCamp and LinkedIn. Completed GitHub "Hello World" tutorial. Created a fork for 100-days of code for logging purposes. Completed FCC New Coder Survey 2018 and then went on to finish "Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5" section of FCC curriculum. Finally, of course, completed this log.

**Thoughts:** <br>
It was nice to reacquaint myself with basic HTML skills which definitely needed revisiting given that I'd forgotten some of the information from the Myspace days. Feels good to make a solid start on my webdev journey, to stop procrastinating and put in a good hour of focussed and undisturbed work on something that I genuinely want to do. V. different to the drudgery of completing work during my degree. Also nice to join a set of websites where I can focus my attention rather than jumping all over the place which is something I can tend to do.

**Next Steps:** <br>
-Immerse myself in more general webdev articles, videos and lectures. <br>
-Start "Basic CSS" track on FCC.

### Day 2: Saturday 29th September, 2018

**Today's Progress:** <br>
Completeded "Basic CSS" section of FCC curriculum. Watched various youtube videos centerred around general coding topics, including general overviews of different languages and technologies. Did a local job search to ascertain the desirable skills and languagers UK employers look for within the UK web development field. Finally, of course, completed this log.

**Thoughts:** <br>
Slightly more frustrating than yesterday because I'm less familiar with CSS as opposed to HTML. I felt like the FCC CSS track was not as clearly explained as the HTML track. However, I'm pleased that I finished the section as I was beginning to flag slightly at the end. As a result, I'm a little worried that I won't have retained some information from the last few tasks but I'm sure if I continue to use the skills I'm learning it shouldn't be a problem.

-Start "Applied Visual Design" track on FCC.<br>
-Plough on with 100 days of code.

### Day 3: Sunday 30th September, 2018

**Today's Progress:** <br>
Started "Applied Visual Design" section of FCC curriculum and completed first 35 tasks. Watched a few youtube videos about other people's journeys in learning to code. Finally, of course, completed this log.

**Thoughts:** <br>
Enjoyed more than yesterday as it felt like I was finally learning totally new information which was quite rewarding. Also appreciated the fact that some of this track was more design-centric. Therefore some of the things I was learning to control using CSS actually looked visually appealing rather than some geocities-looking markup.
