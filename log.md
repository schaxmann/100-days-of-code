# 100 Days Of Code - Schaxmann's Log

### Day 1: Friday 28th September, 2018

**Today's Progress:** <br>
Signed up for GitHub, StackOverflow, 100-days-of-code Slack, FreeCodeCamp and LinkedIn. Completed GitHub "Hello World" tutorial. Created a fork for 100-days of code for logging purposes. Completed FCC New Coder Survey 2018 and then went on to finish "Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5" section of FCC curriculum. Finally, of course, completed this log.

**Thoughts:** <br>
It was nice to reacquaint myself with basic HTML skills which definitely needed revisiting given that I'd forgotten some of the information from the Myspace days. Feels good to make a solid start on my webdev journey, to stop procrastinating and put in a good hour of focussed and undisturbed work on something that I genuinely want to do. V. different to the drudgery of completing work during my degree. Also nice to join a set of websites where I can focus my attention rather than jumping all over the place which is something I can tend to do.

**Next Steps:** <br>
-Immerse myself in more general webdev articles, videos and lectures. <br>
-Start "Basic CSS" track on FCC.

### Day 2: Saturday 29th September, 2018

**Today's Progress:** <br>
Completeded "Basic CSS" section of FCC curriculum. Watched various youtube videos centerred around general coding topics, including general overviews of different languages and technologies. Did a local job search to ascertain the desirable skills and languagers UK employers look for within the UK web development field. Finally, of course, completed this log.

**Thoughts:** <br>
Slightly more frustrating than yesterday because I'm less familiar with CSS as opposed to HTML. I felt like the FCC CSS track was not as clearly explained as the HTML track. However, I'm pleased that I finished the section as I was beginning to flag slightly at the end. As a result, I'm a little worried that I won't have retained some information from the last few tasks but I'm sure if I continue to use the skills I'm learning it shouldn't be a problem.

-Plough on with 100 days of code.

### Day 3: Sunday 30th September, 2018

**Today's Progress:** <br>
Started "Applied Visual Design" section of FCC curriculum and completed first 35 tasks. Watched a few youtube videos about other people's journeys in learning to code. Finally, of course, completed this log.

**Thoughts:** <br>
Enjoyed more than yesterday as it felt like I was finally learning totally new information which was quite rewarding. Also appreciated the fact that some of this track was more design-centric. Therefore some of the things I was learning to control using CSS actually looked visually appealing rather than some geocities-looking markup.

### Day 4: Monday 1st October, 2018

**Today's Progress:** <br>
Completed "Applied Visual Design" section of FCC curriculum. Watched a few youtube videos centerred around web dev topics to try and acquaint myself more with the general happenings and trends in the field. Finally, of course, completed this log.

**Thoughts:** <br>
I was tired, with work and friend's Birthday it was all a bit mad, didn't manage to start till super late. Still pleased I find myself sitting here and doing it though. Demonstrates to me how important it is to commit to something like this challenge. Admittedly I didn't follow all the rules and haven't told anyone I'm doing it, but in a way I almost feel like that's more rewarding; just skilling up on the sly.

### Day 5: Wednesday 3rd October, 2018

**Today's Progress:** <br>
Got halfway through "Applied Accesibility" section of FCC curriculum. Watched more youtube videos centerred around web dev and although its a more passive version of learning, I do want to make this a keystone habit so I can keep up with current trends. Finally, of course, completed this log.

**Thoughts:** <br>
I dun fucked up and missed Tuesdays progress. I thought about starting again with the 100 days so it was continous and then I thought 'fuck it'. I'm just gonna carry on and get 100 days code under my belt, continuous or otherwise. I really should have perhaps done more to try and make up for lost time but I don't want to burn myself out and quit so I didn't finish as much as I would have liked but who cares, this is for me, nobody else.

### Day 6: Thursday 4th October, 2018

**Today's Progress:** <br>
Finished "Applied Accesibility" section of FCC curriculum. Watched more youtube videos. Finally, of course, completed this log.

**Thoughts:** <br>
Back to consecutive days so feel glad to be back on the horse. Today's challenges were kinda boring can't lie because I enjoy the creative element of web dev and learning about accesibility for screen readers etc doesn't really feel like that. However, I do appreciate that implementation of these elements is important for impaired users. I also was tempted to do the "Responsive Web Design Principles" track because it's so short but I figured I'll leave it for tomorrow because I think it's more likely to get me back to the computer if I think I've got a nice short track to kick things off with.

### Day 8: Tuesday 9th October, 2018

**Today's Progress:** <br>
Finished "CSS Grid" section of FCC curriculum. Finally, of course, completed this log.

**Thoughts:** <br>
Finally back on a bit of a streak. I enjoyed today because CSS grid seems quite powerful in comparison to some of the stuff I've been learning and as a result was a little more interesting. I can only imagine this will continue moving forward. I was already imagining creative ways I might be able to use this technique. However, I am a little apprehensive about the projects moving forward because I know how much referring back to the lessons they are going to take. In the long run, though, I know this will help cement the things that I have learned.
